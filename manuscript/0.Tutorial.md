# The World of Ogres

Being born in the middle of the continent, humans have long been caught between the great armies of the old nations never being able to settle down on the chaotic battlefields they called home. After the five nations sign the great peace a few centuries ago, humans settle down and were at last being able to build cities. Since relationship among the nations was still fragile, human cities quickly became a neutral ground making them the center of trade and diplomacy among the five nations. Humanity has thriven during peace becoming the dominant race of the continent.

Then the first demons appear in the south where the plant people were quickly decimated by hordes of harpies. The dryad empress seeks help from the human king, but since commerce was flourishing without herbs, fruits and vegetables coming from the dryad, humans refused to help them. After all, humanity had long master agriculture and could easily produce what the dryad grow before.

The mountain folks come second to ask for help against the troll demons that were invading the mountains of the north, but the human king ignores their plea. Humanity had mines of their own and mastered the intense fire of the forge. Dvergar’s steel was a commodity that humans could live without.

One by one, the three other nations beg humanity to help them fight the demons spawning in their land. However, humans had developed so quickly that they did not need anything from the old nations anymore letting them suffer the wrath of the demons. Thus, the Naga fall prey to the hunt of the Rakshasa demons. The Tengu had been cursed by the Oni losing their ability to use their wing to fly. Even the mighty Jinn that has mastered terrible magic had their nation collapse before the Ghül invasion.

As humanity sees the old nations fall, they were content accumulating great riches and building wonderful cities. Humans thought that they were not like the other nations, that they were strong and would prevail if demons appeared on their land. Nevertheless, their capital was burned to ashes by the dragon and his army of Ogres in a single night. Humans had nobody to turn to, and thus humanity fall.

The stories of Ogres are about characters trying to survive in a world that have fallen to demons. The grudge from the old world has vanished as members of all nations are trying to survive together. While this is a dark time dominates by demons enslaving most of the population, there are still heroes out there trying to make the world a better place. As long as those heroes stand up against the demon, there is hope for a better tomorrow.

# The Game

Ogres is a game where players collaboratively build the tale of heroes trying to survive in a world that has fallen to demons. One player, called the storyteller, will be responsible for defining the global framework of a story in which each player will take the role of an individual hero with their own personality and capabilities.

The story can take a single game session to tell, but most of the time it will take more than one gaming session mimicking chapters or scene of traditional storytelling. Some story has a predefine ending determine at the start of the game, but most stories are open-ended. When the characters reach the end of a storyline, they start again on a new adventure.

A game session takes the form of a dialog between all the players taking the role of their favorite hero. Players advance the story by describing how their heroes try to achieve the goals they have set for the group or for their individual hero. The storyteller will throw in some complications and challenges to spice things up and the players will then describe how their hero overcomes such challenges.

Sometime it is obvious that the solution describe by the player will succeed or failed, but sometimes you will need to refer to the rules to determine the outcome of a hero’s decision. Each hero is described by aspects that determine their degree of expertise in overcoming some problems in a certain way. This expertise is translated into a die roll that will determine the outcome of a hero’s action.

To learn the rules of the game, you can start right away by following the quick start adventure in section 1 of this book. This first adventure slowly explains the basic rules of the game as the story unfolds. Alternatively, you can read the rules references of section 2 if you prefer a more formal approach to learn the game.

-# Quick start adventure

The introductory adventure of this book contains four challenges that allows players to progressively learn the rules of the game. The first challenge is simple, requiring a single die roll while the last challenge is more complex requiring multiple roll split into many rounds and require managing resources.

This adventure is designed for 2 to 7 players, but ideally the sweet spot is to have around 4 or 5 players. One of the players will take the mantle of the storyteller and will direct the adventure while the other players will choose a character to play. The game should be completed in a single game session that last between 3 to 4 hours.

An adventure is a framework for the story in which the character will evolve. An adventure is split into many challenges that the players will need to solve. The full adventure will be described in the next section but here is a quick summary of the whole story.

The characters barely escape an ogre raid that destroyed their home village. After surviving a night into a neighbor forest, they discover that the ogres are marching toward a nearby city. The characters must reach the city before the ogres to warn them of their impending doom.

During the adventure, the characters will overcome the following challenges:

1. Hide from the ogres searching for them;
2. Survive the night in a forest;
3. Beat the ogres to the nearest village to warn them of the incoming attack;
4. Survive a fight before reaching the village.

Each scene in the adventure contains a description of the challenge that must be communicated by the storyteller to the other players. The simplest way to do that is to simply read the sample text in italics.

More experienced storyteller should feel free to change names, locations or descriptions that fit more their style. Remember that an adventure is only a framework and if the storyteller, or any players, have an idea that is more fun than what is described here, feel free to adapt the framework to tell the story you want.

At the beginning of the adventure, Yarim, is introduced as the guard captain that helps the character escape the raid. Yarim is what is called a Non-player’s character (NPC), i.e. a character that is controlled uniquely by the storyteller. NPCs are one of the storyteller tools to give the story a direction and gives players clues about what to do next. Yarim should not be used to resolve challenge, but will give advice to the characters and help them only if needed.

This section broadly describes the basic elements of the game: characters, rules and adventures.

# The Characters

Each player should choose a character between the six sample characters provided for this adventure. Do not worry if you do not understand the meaning of every aspect of a character, everything will be explained as you need them during the adventure. If you are an experienced RPG player, you might prefer to create your own character as describe in the character creation section instead of choosing a pre-generated character.

Characters are described by many aspects that have different purposes in the game. Each aspect is accompanied by a number which represents the expertise level of the character in this aspect. The higher the number, the better the character is with this aspect. These aspects are competences, resources and resistances.

The character sheet describing each character is split into six sections. 

1. The description section explains the background of the character and their motivations.
2. The character resources can be spent to gain a benefit or may be lost when failing a challenge. If there are two numbers, the first one represents the long term pool which is replenished slowly and the second number the short term pool which is replenished rapidly.
3. The character competences determine expertise in a broad field and the number of dice to roll when solving a challenge.
4. The character resistances determine how difficult it is for others to affect your character with one of their actions.
5. The fighting section shows the five ways to attack an opponent and the defensive action that a character can make. The first number determines expertise in offense while the second number represent resistance against the attack.
6. Special abilities of character. The first ability listed comes from the character equipment while the last one represents ability of the character developed by their training.

## Karasu the Tengu archer

The three Isamu brothers had a promising military career being in one of the best divisions of the Tengu army. When the curse has been cast on the Tengu, the Military force fell in chaos and their career stop abruptly. Since they were no more Tengu army, Karasu and his brothers move to serve in the army of the other races to advance their military position. Their last affectation was with the human military and they were stationed at Amun. Karasu has just been dispatched to Liddle Village while his brothers remains in Amun. It was just supposed to be a routine affectation, but the Ogres attack change everything.

## Manasa the Naga slave

Manasa has been raised as a slave to Rakshasa demons after her parent die in the Great hunt. As a teen, she was able to escape her master’s clutch but her life would not get better. Without family, she lives in the streets of big cities begging for food and money. The street life is harsh for a young Naga and she has fought many thugs to protect her life.

When the Human capital fall last year, she moves to Amun where life was kinder to her. She even met Joacquim, a farmer from Liddle Village that hire her to work on his farm. Now that Joacquim is dead, she will probably end back on the streets of Amun begging for food.

# The Rules

Facing a challenge required players to describe what their character will do to avoid one of the threats composing the challenge, this is call a maneuver. With that description in mind, the storyteller determines if the maneuver should succeed or not based on common sense. Sometimes, it is not obvious that a maneuver will succeed or not because it depends on the character competences. The storyteller then determine which of the character's Competences will be used to solve the maneuver. The expertise level of the character in this competence will determine the maneuver roll to make.

The player rolls a number of Competence dice (d6) equal to their character expertise level in the appropriate competence. Character with zero dice, such as inexperience character, roll two dice and take the lowest one as their result. A die greater or equal than the target number (TN) create a success. If the player gets at least one success, the character accomplish his maneuver.

The target number vary from 4 to 6 depending if the character has advantage or disadvantage with the maneuver. Advantage is gained if the character expertise is higher than the difficulty of the maneuver and disadvantage if the expertise is lower. Advantage and disadvantage may also be granted on a maneuver depending on favorable or unfavorable situation. If a character has both advantage and disadvantage at the same time, they cancel each other and the roll is made normally.

|  TN | Situation                       |
| --- | ------------------------------- |
|  4  | Advantage                       |
|  5  | No advantage or disadvantage    |
|  5  | Both advantage and disadvantage |
|  6  | Advantage                       |

Some maneuvers might require to determine how well the character succeeds by determining the degree of success. The player then rolls a Success die (between a d4 and a d12) for each success and take the highest die as the degree of success for the maneuver.

In summary, to resolve a challenge where the outcome is not obvious, the players must follow those steps:

1. The player describes what his character tries to accomplish to avoid a threat;
2. The storyteller determines the competence that best fit what the character wants to do;
3. The expertise level of the character in that competence determines:
    1. How many Competence dice to roll;
    2. The target number of each Competence die.
4. The player rolls the dice and each die higher or equal than the target number count as a success;
5. If needed, the player roll a success die for each success and pick the highest one as the degree of success for his character maneuver.

# The Adventure

## Introduction

> *You are all standing on the outskirts of the forest looking at the huge column of smoke rising from the remains of the village you called home. The village of Liddle was attack by surprise by a band of ogres coming from the east. The half dozen soldiers stationed in the village were no match against the small army of ogres.*

> *The chilling autumn wind bring the smell of fire and burned flesh of your friends and family. You look around yourself to count the survivor: only [number of character + 1] survived... so few. You look at Yarim, the battered down guard captain that help your group escape alive from the attack. Blood cover his cloth, pain are in his eyes, but yet he stand up protecting the survivors. Yarim turn his head abruptly and say in a soft voice: "Movement from the south, those damn ogres are on our tail. Lets hide in the forest and hope they do not find us there."*

## First challenge: Hiding from the enemy

The first challenge the characters will face is hiding from the ogres searching for them. To keep things simple in the first challenge, there is only one possible maneuver to overcome the challenge, hiding that use the dissimulation competence.

This is a group challenge, whether all the characters succeed or the whole group will fail. In a group challenge, a character with more than one success can help another character by giving them one of their extra successes. In other words, the total number of successes of the group must be equal to the number of characters participating in the challenge.

Here is the formal description of a maneuver starting by its name, the competence used to resolve that maneuver and its difficulty level. Then it is followed by a description of the maneuver and the consequences for failing the maneuvers.

| Hiding from ogres (Competence: Dissimulation, Difficulty: 2) |
| --- |
| The characters tries to hide in the forest behind whatever they can find: trees, bushes or rocks. |
| **Failure:** The Ogre see one of the character that failed his maneuver. Before the Ogre even start moving toward the group, Yarim goes out of hiding to distract the Ogre and yell to the characters to flee deeper in the forest. Yarim survives his encounter with the Ogre and join back the group after a few minutes. Unfortunately, he was seriously wounded by the Ogre and Yarim will not be able to help the characters in the following challenges. |

## Roleplaying Opportunity

Between challenges, it is generally a good time for players to roleplay their character and interact with the other character. Some group like to talk as if it were their character talking, but some other prefers to simply describe the interaction between characters. Try both approaches during the adventure and see what best fit your group.

As your group get better at roleplaying their character, the gamemaster will not need to create roleplaying opportunity as the player will go forward by themselves. But to get them started, you can use Yarim to start a conversation.

> *As your group catch it's breath, Yarim look at everybody and say: "We're gonna stay here for the night, it's too dangerous to move at night. Who know what other demons are in the region. If we have to survive this, I'll need to know what you are capable of doing."*

The let the player interact between them by introducing themselves in character voice or by describing their character to the other players.

## Second challenge: surviving the night

The characters have taken refuge in the woods after the attack, but before the night come they will have to make camp. The characters may face up to 3 threats for the night: Weariness, Hunger and Cold. The storyteller should choose 1 threat per 2 players. Each player will have access to a maneuver and their action pools to face the challenge or their character will suffer from strains.

If the players have succeeded at the first challenge, Yarim have one action to aid any other character on their maneuver, but if they failed the first maneuver, Yarim is too wounded to do anything except some talking.

This challenge introduce four new concepts:

- Degree of success;
- Actions that complement maneuvers;
- Energy spend to improve maneuvers or gain extra actions.
- Strains as a penalty for failing challenges;

### Degree of Success

In the first challenge, a success means that a character avoid the threat, but in this challenge, the number of characters avoiding a threat is determined by the degree of success of a maneuver. After a successful maneuver, the player rolls a number of dice equal to the successes of the maneuver and pick the highest die. The die type to roll is specified in the success entry of the maneuver description.

### Actions

An action is something mundane that a character does that do not require a specific competence and do not require any die roll. Hunting an animal for food requires some competence and a maneuver roll, but cooking the meat to be edible is mundane and automatically succeed.

An action can also be spent to support a maneuver. To do so, the player describes how his character helps another character or how he used knowledge from another field of expertise to help himself. The helper rolls a single Competence die against the difficulty of the task. If the roll is successful, add a success to the character making the maneuver. A character can receive any amount of extra success, but cannot have more successes than his competence level.

The number of actions a character receive at the start of a challenge is specified on the character sheet under the Action entry in the resources sections. While a character can have multiple actions, each action must be used for a different purpose. For example, a player cannot use two actions to help with the same maneuver.

### Energy

Energy is split into two pools: Exhaustion and Fatigue. On the character sheet, under the energy entry, the first number represents exhaustion while the second one, Fatigue.

Fatigue represents short-term energy and is depleted first and is completely restored after a challenge. Exhaustion is depleted when a character is pushed beyond normal fatigue and is partially restored when the character has the time to take a complete rest. During this adventure, the characters will not have the opportunity to take a complete rest and thus will not regain lost Exhaustion.

One or more Energy points can be spend to:

- increase the degree of success of a maneuver, up to the success die maximum.
- take an extra action.

### Strains

Failing to overcome a threat will cause a level of strain to the character reducing both its maximum Hit points and Energy points starting with the short term pool (Defense and Fatigue). The first level of strain reduce the pools maximum by 1 point, the second level by 2 more points and so on. As for spending energy, strains are cumulative, meaning that a character with 2 levels of strain reduce its pools maximum by a total of 3 points.

| Level of strains                            |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |
| ------------------------------------------- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Cumulative reduction of maximum pool points |  -1   |  -3   |  -6   |  -10  |

Reduced hit points will make the fourth challenge more difficult and reduced Energy will make all following challenges harder by having fewer resources to get extra action or increase degree of success.

### Dealing with the threats

Now that you know how to overcome the threats of the second challenge, we will look in more detail how each specific threat can be dealt with. Each threat will list the competence generally used to face it, the difficulty of the threat and the success die that determines the degree of success.

Roleplaying games are about freedom of action and imagination and it is impossible to list all the ways a challenge can be overcome. If a player finds an interesting way to resolve a challenge that is not listed in the threat description, the storyteller should find a suitable competence to roll, assign a difficulty level of 2 or 3 and a success die of d6 or d8 based on the description of the threat.

#### Cold

The nights are cold at this time of the year. If the storyteller chooses this threat, a cold wind blows in the forest chilling the bones of the characters. If the threat is not chosen, the storyteller describes the night as one of the last warm nights of the season.

| Starting a fire (Competence: Craft, Difficulty: 2, Success: 1d8) |
| --- |
| The character rub two sticks together in order to start a fire. An action will be needed to fetch enough woods for the night.|
| **Failure:** Cold strains. |

| Find a natural shelter (Competence: Nature, Difficulty: 3, success: 1d6) |
| --- |
| The nature competence can be used to find a burrow where the group will be protected from the cold wind.|
| **Failure:** Cold strains. |

#### Hunger

The attack happens before supper and characters are starving. If the storyteller chooses this threat, the character must find food themselves in the forest. If the storyteller do not choose this threat, Yarim have bread and cheese in his backpack and happily share it with everybody.

To find food, characters can try to hunt for meat or pick small fruits from bushes. Finding fruits will be harder than hunting since it is late fall, but hunting requires a fire to cook the meat.

| Hunting (Competence: Animal, Difficulty: 2, Success: 1d8) |
| --- |
| The character goes hunting small animal in the forest. The characters won't eat raw meat so a fire must be build (see cold threat above) and an action must be spend to prepare and cook the meat.|
|**Failure:** Hunger strains. |

| Gathering (Competence: Nature, Difficulty: 3, success: 1d6) |
| --- |
| The character goes fruit picking and will bring berries and apple to the group.|
| **Failure:** Hunger strains. |

#### Weariness

If the storyteller chooses the Weariness threat, characters will need to find a place where they will be able to sleep well enough not to be tired in the morning. If this threat is not chosen, the storyteller simply explain that Yarim already know a nice clearing in the forest where they will be able to make camp.

To face this threat, the characters might search for a suitable place to camp in the forest or build a camp from trees and branches. Building a camp is more difficult than finding a safe place, but will shelter more characters.

| Finding a resting place (Competence: Nature, Difficulty: 2, Success: 1d6) |
| --- |
| The nature competence can be used to find a nice place in the forest where the group will be able to sleep on soft ground.|
| **Failure:** Weariness strains. |

| Build a camp (Competence: Craft, Difficulty: 3, success: 1d8) |
| --- |
| The character can use woods and leaves to build a small shelter where people will be able to rest peacefully.|
| **Failure:** Weariness strains. |

## Third challenge: warn the city

> *Dawn has only begun and Yarim stirs everyone from their uncomfortable sleep. "The ogres are marching towards the city of Amun. If they are caught by surprise like we were, they are lost. If we hurry, we might be able to warn them and help them prepare a proper defense. We should move now."*

The road between Liddle and Amun cross three zones: Liddle Forest where the characters have spent the night, the Usha rivers and the Amun plain. To travel through each zone, the characters will need to succeed in different maneuvers. Each maneuver requires that the group accumulate at least one success per character.

In this challenge, you will learn about:
- Multiple rounds challenge
- Time challenge

### Multiple rounds

Since this challenge requires many maneuvers, it will be split into multiple rounds. In the first round, each character received their starting amount of actions and one maneuver. When all characters have acted, a new round begins and each character receives another maneuver and 1 action point. Actions not spent in a round can be used in further rounds, but maneuvers that are not used are automatically converted into an extra action. Your character can have more actions than their starting amount, but extra actions are lost at the end of the challenge.

Don't forget, if the players have succeed at the first challenge, Yarim will be able to contribute an action each round to help the characters. If the first challenge has failed, Yarim will be of no help.

### Time Challenge

This is a time challenge meaning that the characters have a limited time to succeed at all challenges. The ogres will reach Amun Village in 8 hours, so the characters must reach their destination in this amount of time.

Each zone requires a certain amount of time to travel depending on the path chosen by the characters. The players must choose each path wisely so that the sum of the time it takes to succeed does not go over 8 hours.

Some path asks for an easy maneuver, but take a longer time to travel while other are harder but require less time. But for each round that end, you must add an extra hour to the total of the travel. Short path may take more time than long one if it requires many rounds to acquire the necessary success to follow them.

### Hunger threat

Furthermore, the characters will face a hunger threat, so they will need to spend at least one action eating before reaching Amun Village or they will suffer from a strain level.

If they are lucky, they will have leftovers from the previous day. If not, they will need to spend maneuvers searching for food. The maneuver difficulty will depend in which zone the characters try to find food.

| Hunting/Fishing (Competence: Animal) |
| --- |
| **- Liddle forest (Difficulty: 2, Success: 1d8)** |
| **- Usha river (Difficulty: 1, Success: 1d6)** |
| **- Amun plain (Difficulty: 3, Succes: 1d4)** |
| The character goes hunting small animal or goes fishing in the Usha river. The characters won't eat raw meat so a fire must be build (a craft maneuver with difficulty 2 in all zone) and an action must be spend to prepare and cook the meat. |
| **Failure:** Hunger strains. |

| Gathering (Competence: Nature) |
| --- |
| **- Liddle forest (Difficulty: 3, Success: 1d6)** |
| **- Usha river (Difficulty: 3, Success: 1d4)** |
| **- Amun plain (Difficulty: 1, Success: 1d8)** |
| The character goes fruit picking and will bring berries and apple to the group. |
| **Failure:** Hunger strains. |

### Liddle Forest

To cross Liddle Forest, the characters have two options. They can either take the old northern trail which takes four hours to travel or cut through the forest which requires only two hours but require a more difficult navigation maneuver to avoid getting lost in the forest.

| The old northern trail (Competence: Navigation, Difficulty: 1, Time: 4 hours) |
| --- |
| There is an old trail in the forest that is not used much anymore since the northern mine has closed. The trail should be easy to follow without getting lost but unfortunately Amun lies to the south west of Liddle making it a detour. |

| Cut through the forest (Competence: Navigation, Difficulty: 3, Time: 2 hours) |
| --- |
| The characters may decide to use the direct route and go south west from their position, but the forest is thick and you can easily get lost. |

### Usha River

The Usha river area can be traveled in about two hours at a fast pace, but there are only a few places where the river can be crossed safely.

| Use main bridge (Competence: Dissimulation, Difficulty: 4, Time: 2 hours) |
| --- |
| The quickest way to cross the Usha river is to use the bridge of the main road. Unfortunately, it is also the path the ogres army is marching. If they take this path, the character will have to cross the bridge without being seen by the ogre army. |

| Cross the ford (Competence: Acrobatic, Difficulty: 2, Time: 3 hours) |
| --- |
| South of the Usha bridge lie the grey ford, a narrow point in the river where the characters can jump from rocks to rocks to cross water requiring some acrobatic skills. |

| Build a bridge (Competence: Craft, Difficulty: 1, Time: 4 hours) |
| --- |
| Even further south, there lie a little patch of wood where the character can craft a makeshift bridge with a fallen tree and safely cross the river. |

### Amun plain

The Amun plain offer no particular challenges to the characters, but if they are running out of time, they might be required to rush through the plain to get to the village before the ogres.

| Fast walk (Competence: Athletic, Difficulty: 1, Time: 3 hours) |
| --- |
| If the character have taken some advance, they can cross the plain at a quick pace and still reach the village before the ogres. |

| Jogging (Competence: Athletic, Difficulty: 2, Time: 2 hours) |
| --- |
| If the characters had some difficulties in the other areas, they might need to run part of the plain by increasing their pace. |

| Running (Competence: Athletic, Difficulty: 3, Time: 1 hour) |
| --- |
| If the characters are out of time, they will have no choice to push their legs to their limit and run without stopping to catch their breath. |

### Slowing the ogres

If the players think that their characters will need more than 8 hours to reach Amun, they can try to slow down the ogres. This can be risky because if the maneuver does not succeed, the ogres will understand the characters plan and will march faster reaching Amun one hour earlier.

| Falling a tree (Competence: Nature, Difficulty: 3) |
| --- |
| While in Liddle forest, the nature competence can be used to fell trees on the road used by the ogres. Even if the ogres are very strong, they will need some time to clear the road.|
| **Failure:** The ogres will reach Amun in one less hour. |

| Collapsing the bridge (Competence: Sabotage, Difficulty: 2) |

| **Failure:** The ogres will reach Amun in one less hour. |

## Final challenge: ambushed

For the final challenge, the character will need to survive a combat against demons. The goal of a combat is to deplete the enemies hit point pool before the player’s pool is depleted. Each successful attack maneuver will reduce the hit points of an opponent starting with Defense. When the opponent has no more defense, he is at a disadvantage and Health is reduced afterward. When a combatant has no health left, the combatant is incapacitated i.e. fall unconscious and cannot act until a health point is recovered.

To prevail in combat, characters will have to manage their resources carefully (actions, hit points and energy) and use the battlefield to their best advantage. Combat is resolved as a multi-round challenge that end when a side is defeated, surrender or flee the battlefield. Each round of combat is further divided into three distinct phases: offensive, defensive and reactive.

The flow of battle goes like that:

1. Roll a Military maneuver to assess the battlefield to gain Initiative and extra actions.
2. Players with initiative act first in the offensive phase.
3. The defensive phase start and it's the turn of the demons to attack.
4. In the reactive phase, characters that have not acted yet can do so.
5. Start again at step 2 until one side is defeated.

All maneuvers in the same phase happen simultaneously and the resolution order is decided between the players or by the storyteller for the defensive phase.

### Assess the battlefield

At the start of the combat, every player rolls a Military maneuver to assess the battlefield. Each success allows the character to either gain an extra action or gain Initiative. Gaining initiative allows a character to act in the offensive phase of a round and fight at an optimum reach in close combat.

During combat, a player can assess the battlefield as often as he wants by using their maneuver for the round to do so.

### Player's turn (Offensive and reactive phase)

A character with Initiative can make its maneuver either in the offensive or reactive phase and aid character acting in any of those phases. A character without Initiative can only make its maneuvers in the reactive phase or help others in the same phase.

On its turn a character can:

1. Support a maneuver (action);
2. Occupy a vantage point (action);
3. Engage an opponent (action);
4. Enter a combat stance (action);
5. Attack an opponent (maneuver);
    - The difficulty is determined by the opponent appropriate resistance for the attack;
    - The success die is determined by the opponent's armor and the result is subtracted from the defender hit points.

#### Support a maneuver

As for any other type of maneuver, players can spend an action to support an offensive maneuver during combat. The difficulty of the action is the resistance of the opponent against the offensive maneuver.

#### Occupy a vantage point

A battlefield can have multiple vantage points that give a benefit to a combatant that take advantage of it. To gain the benefits of a vantage point, the player must spend an action point to occupy it. As long as that character occupies the vantage point, no other character can use it. A character can be removed from a vantage point with a Combat maneuver.

For example, there is an old cart in the barn which can provide cover against range attack for a single character that occupies the vantage points.

#### Engage an opponent

During combat, combatants are constantly moving around the battlefield. In order to attack a specific opponent in close combat (hand-to-hand or melee), a character must first engage the opponent by spending an action point. When engaged, combatants are less mobile and require spending one additional action points per engaged enemy when trying to occupy a vantage point or engage another opponent. Furthermore, to hinder the attack of an opponent in the defensive phase, the character must be engaged with the foe. Engagement can be broken by a successful Combat maneuver.

Range attack (thrown or missile) does not require to be engaged with an opponent first. Range attack works best when not engage and when the target is not engaged either. If either the attacker or the defender is engaged to another foe, range attack are made at disadvantage, both on maneuver rolls and on damage.

#### Enter a combat stance

An action can be spend to enter a stance which provide a benefit to the character as long as focus is kept on the stance. The maximum number of stance a character can focus on is determine by their Focus resource. When at their maximum stance, a character must abandon one of their current stance if they want to benefits from another one.

#### Attack an opponent

A big part of combat strategy is to pick the most appropriate offensive maneuver to pierce the defense of an opponent. There are five different offensive maneuvers to choose from when making an attack. The difficulty of an attack maneuver depends on the appropriate resistance of the defender.

To make an attack, the player rolls the appropriate competence and for each success, decide whether his character:

- incapacitate the opponent;
- cause a combat effect.

**Incapacitate:** For each success spend to incapacitate an opponent, you roll a success die and pick the highest one. The success die is determined by your opponent armor type. The defender then subtract the highest Success die from their hit points pool starting with Defense and then by Health. When Defense is depleted, the character is at disadvantage and losing Health means that the character is wounded by the attack.

| Armor type  | No Armor | Light Armor | Medium armor | Heavy armor |
| ----------- | :------: | :---------: | :----------: | :---------: |
| Success die |   1d10   |     1d8     |      1d6     |     1d4     |

In close combat, weapons can have either a reach of hand-to-hand or melee. The opponent who has the initiative determine at which reach an engagement happens. A combatant force to fight at a reach inappropriate for their weapon is disadvantaged on their success roll i.e. they roll one less success die. If the amount of success die is reduced to 0, they roll two success die, but keep the worst one.

In range combat, you are at disadvantage on Success die if either you or your target is engaged in close combat.

When fighting unarmed against armed opponents, the unarmed combatant is always at disadvantage on Success die and treat armor as one category better. Against heavy armor, the attack deals no damage.

**Combat effect:** Instead of rolling a success die, an attacker may choose a combat effect depending on the offensive maneuver used. An attacker that spends all his Success die on combat effect does not deal damage to the defender.

Certain combat effect allows the attacker to enter a combat stance to hinder an opponent. Such stances are in effect as long as the attacker keep focus and stay engage with the hindered opponent. IF the attacker decide to not enter the stance for any reason, the attack effect last until the end of the round instead.

### Opponent's Turn (Defensive Phase)

During the defensive phase, it is the turn of the demon to retaliate against the character. If there is a free vantage point that can be useful to the demons, do not hesitate to occupy that vantage point. As a rule of thumb, a demon will attack opponents that are already engaged with them.

Even if it is the opponents turn, characters can be active by:

1. hindering an attack
2. defending against an attack.

#### Hinder an attack

If you are engaged with an opponent, you can try to hinder any of if its attack by spending an action. The player describes how his character hinder the attacker and the player roll a single Competence die from the appropriate competence against the expertise of the attack. If the roll is successful, the number of successes of the attacker is reduced by one.

A character can only spend one action hindering an attacker, but many different characters can hinder the same opponent.

#### Defend against an attack

A player can spend an action to either parry, block or dodge an attack that is directed against their character. The player rolls a single Competence die against the expertise of the attack. If the roll is successful, the number of successes of the attacker is reduced by one. Only a single defensive action can be taken against an offensive maneuver.

**Block**: The defender use his shield to block any offensive maneuver. The expertise of a block is determined by the grade of the shield.

**Dodge**: Then defender takes a step to avoid a close attack or a thrown weapon. The expertise of a dodge is determined by the Acrobatics competence.

**Parry**: The defender use his close weapon to deflect or block an attacker close attack. The expertise of a parry is determined by the grade of the weapon.

### Combat Challenge

> *As you approach Amun, you hear monstrous screams in the sky. As you look up, you see a flock of winged women covered in thick, dark feathers. As they scream again, they plunge toward your group with their sharp talons ready to tear you apart. Fortunately, there is an old barn nearby where you can take shelter. As you close the door behind you, you notice that the old barn wasn't a shelter, but a trap. There is an hole in the roof where [1 per 2 characters] harpies are already entering the barn.*
> *As you take a moment to look around, you notice an old broken cart behind which you can hide and a pile of old straw ballot that smells humidity but can give someone a higher ground, a perfect position for ranged attack. On the far end of the barn there is an old ladder to access what used to be a second floor. While the floor board have mostly fallen, the beam seems solid enough to walk on it. Below the hole in the roof, there is a patch of slippery mud that is sure to hinder any combatant fighting in that area.*

#### The battlefield

The combat takes place in an old barn and the characters have interest in taking advantage of the following battlefield features.

| **Feature**    | **Effect** |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| *Obstacles*    |

During the combat, the siren will fly near the roof avoiding close combat if she can. Only character with range attack or that position themselves on a beam can attack her while flying. The siren will use her captivating song in the first round and will trade maneuvers to either lure or mesmerize captivated opponents to make it easier for the other harpies to attack the characters.

The siren captivating song is an area attack that can affect all characters. A single roll is made and the result is compare to every character resistance individually. To quickly resolve this roll the gamemaster can announce which resistance level is required to resist the roll. For example, the siren captivating song maneuver is 2d6 vs. Presence. If the highest die is a 4, characters with a Presence of 1 or less are affected by the attack. If the highest die is a 5, character with Presence 2 or lower are affected. If the highest die is a 6, every character are affected.
